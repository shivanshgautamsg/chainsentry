# 🛡️ ChainSentry

**AI-powered, real-time threat intelligence for open-source supply chains.**  
Detect typosquatting, malicious dependencies, and suspicious maintainer behavior before they hit production.

---

## 🚨 Why ChainSentry?

Supply chain attacks like [XZ Utils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor) and [Polyfill.io hijack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/polyfillio-js-library-used-in-supply-chain-attack-on-100k-sites/) prove that **trusted open-source tools can be turned into weapons**.

ChainSentry proactively scans `npm`, `PyPI`, and `GitHub` for:

- 🧑‍💻 **Maintainer Anomalies**: Odd-hour commits, contributor spikes, timezone mismatches  
- 🧩 **Dependency Risk**: Unexpected package additions, suspicious code patterns  
- 🕵️ **Typosquatting Detection**: Imposters using NLP + entropy  
- 🧨 **Live CVE Monitoring**: Pulls real CVEs from NVD + MITRE attack mapping
